> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Alright need his energy back (it's not a want)
Alright I've been missin' u bad (it's been too
long)
Alright alright I had enough
Enough with this apathy (apathy, yes)
How long have I gone astray (I don't see the
light)
My passion has died away (couldn't even fight)
Oh god please can we just go back
go back to those brighter days
I wasn't right (oh) yeah I've been scandalous
I wasn't wise (oh) such an antagonist
It wasn't nice I know but I learned a lot
baby, let me handle this again
I need you back (yeah yeah)
Never wanted nothin' like I want you tell me
you'll be mine
I need you back (yeah yeah)
Now is not the time to die I must be alive
na na na na na
Now is not the time to die I'm alive
Where have u gone, I'm all alone
yes I've been, yes I've been here livin' on my
own
How can I go on, without u comin' home
I wasn't right (oh) yeah I've been scandalous
I wasn't wise (oh) such an antagonist
It wasn't nice I know but I learned a lot
baby, let me handle this again
Just once again
I need you back, babe (yeah yeah)
Never wanted nothin' like I want you tell me
you'll be mine
I need you back (yeah yeah)
Now is not the time to die I must be alive
na na na na na
Now is not the time to die I'm alive
na na na na na
Now is not the time to die I'm alive
yeah yeah yeah
Need you back in my life
yeah yeah yeah
Need you back I'm alive (I need you back)
